This mat file contains spatial pyramid features for scene15 dataset. The dimension of each feature is 3000.
There are three variables in this file:

(1) featureMat:
A matrix of spatial pyramid features. Each column correspond to one spatial pyramid feature.

(2) filenameMat:
Image file names. Each cell correspond to the features from the same class in 'featureMat'. 

(3) labelMat:
This is a label matrix, each column corresponds to one spatial pyramid feature, where the non-zero position of each column 
indicates the class of the spatial pyramid feature.
